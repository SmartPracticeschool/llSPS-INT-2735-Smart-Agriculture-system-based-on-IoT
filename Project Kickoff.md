# PROJECT KICKOFF

## Project Name - smart Farming system based on IoT - SB52681

## Kickoff Date -06/06/2020 

### WHAT WE HAVE TODAY
In areas where rain doesn’t come regularly or when growing water-hungry crops, farmers are forced to get creative. Irrigation uses groundwater, surface water, and water delivered directly to farms to hydrate thirsty plants.

Evapotranspiration and wind are issues farmers face when trying to get water to plants while avoiding waste. General access to water and a diminished supply are also struggles for farmers in many parts of the country.

There are multiple ways to irrigate. Research has backed numerous effective application strategies, but each farmer has their own preference and budget. 

***DRIP IRRIGATION: WATER TO THE ROOTS***

One approach to getting plants the moisture they need is by sending water directly to the roots with a drip irrigation system or a subsurface drip irrigation system. A drip system is made up of hoses with holes throughout that pump water directly to plant roots within the soil. While this irrigation method is more expensive, farmers see a reduction in water applied. Drip can also be beneficial to oddly shaped or sloped fields.
 
 Today, precision mobile drip irrigation (PMDI) exists, which is in essence a hybrid of drip and center pivot irrigation. PMDI uses drip hoses on a center pivot system, rather than nozzle heads, to get water to plants without getting wheel tracks wet or investing entirely in a drip system.
 
 
 ***CENTER PIVOT IRRIGATION***

This method of irrigating involves long steel arms and sprinkler nozzles and pivots, normally electrically, around a center base to reach the entire field.

When it comes to fertilizations, the farmers manage injections themselves, but having remote control has helped the family dedicate more time to field scouting and nutrient management.


### WHY WE NEED TO CHANGE

In the United States, outdoor water uses alone averages more than 9 billion gallons of water each day, mainly for landscape irrigation. As much as 50% of this water is wasted due to overwatering caused by inefficiencies in traditional irrigation methods and systems. Smart irrigation technology is the answer.

Smart irrigation systems tailor watering schedules and run times automatically to meet specific landscape needs. These controllers significantly improve outdoor water use efficiencies.

Unlike traditional irrigation controllers that operate on a preset programmed schedule and timers, smart irrigation controllers monitor weather, soil conditions, evaporation and plant water use to adjust the watering schedule to actual conditions of the site automatically.

For example, as outdoor temperatures increase or rainfall decreases, smart irrigation controllers consider on site-specific variables, such as soil type, sprinklers’ application rate, etc. to adjust the watering run times or schedules. There are several options for smart irrigation controllers.
 
### WHAT ARE THE KEY MEASURES OF SUCCESS?

The key objective of the paper is to monitor the soil’s moisture content during its dry and wet Conditions with the aid of a moisture sensor circuit, calculate the relative humidity and irrigate it based on its nature using a PC based IOT and GSM system and an automatic water inlet setup which can also monitor and record temperature, humidity and sunlight, which is constantly modified and can be controlled in future to optimize these resources so that the plant growth and yield is maximized.

A record of soil moisture, temperature, rainfall is maintained in a database for backup. This backup is used for weather forecasting and directs the farmers regarding the type of crop to be cultivated in future. IOT gives the whole info to the operator about the irrigation. 
 
### WHO ARE THE KEY STAKEHOLDERS - SPONSOR AND/OR OTHER DECISION MAKERS WHO REPRESENT CONSTITUENCIES THAT WILL BE IMPACTED, AND WHOSE SUPPORT IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THEPROJECT?

A Ward’s linkage cluster analysis was used to cluster participants into homogenous segments based on their responses. Four distinct clusters were identified and titled as proactive consumers (22%), price-sensitive environmentalists (31%), content retirees (31%), and high-end professionals (16%).

Proactive consumers were well-read about irrigation-related topics and wanted more info about water usage. This cluster was the most considerate with regards to future outcome of their actions but was not very environmentally conscious. 

Price-sensitive environmentalists were the least well-read about irrigation-related topics. However, their conduct can be influenced by instruction and information, they consider future outcome, and they are environmentally conscious. 

Content retirees were fairly well-read about irrigation-related topics, but they were less worried about the future consequences of their actions or the environment. 

Unlike the other clusters, the high-end professionals were not strongly impacted by future outcome or environmental factors.
 

### OBJECTIVES
•	Here we are using the Online IoT simulator for getting the Temperature, Humidity and Soil Moisture values.
•	Based on all the parameters the farmer can water his crop by controlling the motors using the mobile application.
•	Even if the farmer is not present near his crop, he can water his crop by controlling the motors using the mobile application from anywhere. 
 
### DELIVERABLES
Farmer is provided a mobile app using which he can monitor the temperature, humidity and soil moisture parameters along with weather forecasting details.
 
### ASSUMPTION
•	Farmer has to have access to internet connection of moderate speed. Preferably GSM or more.
•	Farmer should have access to electricity 24x7.
